            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Founded in 2023, Eklavy was born from a simple idea: language learning should be accessible, 
              engaging, and effective for everyone. Our team of linguists, educators, and developers came 
              together with a shared vision to create a platform that breaks down the barriers of 
              traditional language education.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              The name "Eklavy" draws inspiration from the ancient scholar Eklavya, whose determination 
              and self-motivation exemplify the learning spirit we aim to foster in our community.
            </p>
            
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#123C69] pt-4">Our Mission</h2>
            <p className="text-gray-700">
              At Eklavy, our mission is to empower people worldwide to connect across languages and cultures. 
              We believe that language learning is not just about memorizing vocabulary and grammar rulesâ€”it's 
              about opening doors to new cultures, perspectives, and opportunities.
